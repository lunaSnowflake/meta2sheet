  <h1>Privacy Policy for Meta2Sheet</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-04-12</p>

  <p>Meta2Sheet is a Chrome extension that enables users to easily transfer data from Metabase dashboards to Google Sheets. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the permissions we request and how we use them.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Meta2Sheet does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or passwords.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Used to interact with the current Metabase dashboard page for extracting visible filters.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Required to inject scripts into the current tab for reading Metabase dashboard parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used to locally store user preferences like selected Google Sheet and tab, to improve the user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>identity:</strong> Used to authenticate the user's Google account for accessing Google Sheets via OAuth2.</li>
    <li><strong>cookies:</strong> This extension reads cookies to securely access the active session on Metabase (e.g., metabase.SESSION) in order to extract dashboard data the user is authorized to view. It also uses cookies if required by Google APIs to maintain the authenticated session when transferring data to Google Sheets. No cookie data is stored or transmitted to any third-party servers.</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions:</strong> Required to access and interact with Metabase dashboards that may be hosted on various custom domains. Only interacts with Metabase URLs the user actively navigates to.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Google API Scopes Used</h2>
  <p><strong>Meta2Sheet uses the following Google OAuth scopes to function:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</strong> â€“ Required to create new sheets, update existing ones, and append data to spreadsheets that the user explicitly selects. This is essential for transferring Metabase dashboard data into Google Sheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</strong> â€“ Used to fetch and display a list of spreadsheets from the user's Google Drive, allowing them to choose a destination file. <strong>This permission is read-only</strong>; Meta2Sheet does not create, modify, or delete any files using this scope.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These permissions are requested only with the user's consent and are used solely to support the extensionâ€™s functionality. No spreadsheet or Drive data is stored, transmitted, or shared externally.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>All data processing (such as reading dashboard filters and sending them to Google Sheets) happens locally in your browser or through secure calls to Google APIs. No data is transmitted to any external servers operated by us.</p>

  <h2>Data Responsibility Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Meta2Sheet allows users to transfer data between Metabase and Google Sheets. Depending on how the extension is used, existing data in the destination spreadsheet may be modified or replaced. Users are solely responsible for managing and backing up their data. Meta2Sheet does not accept liability for any data loss or unintended changes resulting from the use of this extension.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Google APIs (such as Google Sheets API) to facilitate data transfer. All communication with Google services is securely handled using industry-standard OAuth2.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as needed. We will notify users through the Chrome Web Store if significant changes are made.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can reach us at:</p>
